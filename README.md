# FREE CODE CAMP PROJECT: WEATHER PAGE
## Objective:
Build a page similar to this [page](http://codepen.io/AdventureBear/full/yNBJRj).

## Rules:
Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself. You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.

## User Stories:
In software development and product management, a user story is a description consisting of one or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function.


- As a user, I can see the weather in my current location.
- As a user, I can see an icon depending on the temperature.
- As a user, I see a different background image depending on the temperature (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert).
- As a user, I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
